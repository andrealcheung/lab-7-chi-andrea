library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns !="NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% #makes groupings based on catagorical variables
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>%  # makes it look like a contingency table 
  select(-gender)
